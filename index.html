    <h1>Communication Skills Overview</h1>
    <p>Communication is a multifaceted process involving the exchange of information, ideas, emotions, and meaning between individuals or groups.<div>It's more than just the transfer of words; it encompasses a deep understanding of the sender's intent, the receiver's interpretation, and the context in which the message is conveyed.</div></p>

 <h1>Barriers in coommunication</h1>
<p> A barrier: This is broadly defined as to any factor or obstacle that hinders the effective communication.
<p><div>These barriers can prevent the intended message from being properly understood, resulting in miscommunication or a breakdown in communication.</div></p>
<ol> 
<h2><div>Barriers of effective communication include;</div></h2> 
<li>Physical Barriers:</li> These obstacles prevent or disrupt communication, such as distance, noise, or even closed doors. These barriers can make it challenging for individuals to hear, see, or interact with each other effectively.
<li>Language Barriers:</li> Differences in language and linguistic abilities can create difficulties in understanding and conveying messages. This barrier can occur when people speak different languages or have different levels of proficiency in a shared language.
<li>Psychological Barriers:</li> These relate to the internal factors that can impact communication. Include personal biases, preconceived notions, and lack of attention or interest, emotional states i.e. anger, fear in the message being conveyed.
<li>Cultural Barriers:</li>Values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can impede communication. Different cultural backgrounds may lead to misinterpretations, misunderstandings, or offensive remarks if not considered and understood.
<li>Organizational Barriers:</li>These stem from the structure, policies, and practices within an organization that may hinder effective communication. They include hierarchical structures, poor leadership, insufficient channels of communication, and a lack of feedback mechanisms.
<li>Technological Barriers</li>: Advancements in technology have brought new communication tools and platforms, but they can also create barriers. Technical issues, unfamiliarity with technology, or limited access to communication devices can hinder effective communication.
<li>Semantic Barriers:</li> These arise when there are differences in the meanings assigned to words, symbols, or gestures. These differences can lead to misunderstandings, as individuals may interpret messages differently based on their own understanding and context.
<li>Lack of subject knowledge:</li> if the sender lacks subject knowledge on the message he's conveying then this could result into misinterpretation of the message by the receiver.

<h2>Other barriers include</h2>
<li>Long difficult words</li>
<li>Unfamiliar words</li>
<li>Long sessions with no breaks</li>
<li>Useless and unnecessary words</li>
<li>Beating about the bush</li>
<li>Poor body language</li>
<li>Spelling and gramma errors</li>
